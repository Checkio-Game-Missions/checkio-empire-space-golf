    Our RoboTrio wants to play golf, but they are too precious and can shot any hole without problem.
    Thus they changed rules. Now you need pass through all hole in any order.

    There are 5 (five) holes on the square field with size 10x10 units.
    You are given coordinates of the holes.
    For the winning you should find the shortest way through all holes and your function must return the length of this
    way.
    You are start in the point (0, 0) and can finish in any hole.
    The result will be checked with &plusmn;0.01 precision.

    In this mission the main goal to make your code as short as possible.
    The shorter code -- more points.
    The points for this mission that you get are dynamic and related with the length of your code.
    We count all characters. 350 characters is the maximum and it's zero points.
    For each character minus from basis you will get 1 point. For example for 300 characters in code you will get 50 points.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> A set of hole coordinates. Each hole coordinates are represented as a tuple of integers.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The length of the shortest path as a float.

    <pre class="brush: python">
golf({(2, 2), (2, 8), (8, 8), (8, 2), (5, 5)}) == 23.31

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    This task is not about elegant or performance code.
    This is about hacks and tricks in python which help you to short your code.
    Of course you don't need to use this in production, but it can help for deep comprehension of python.

    <!--all(isinstance(x, int) and isinstance(y, int) for x, y in holes) == True<br>-->
